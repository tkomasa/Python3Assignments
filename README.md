# Python3
A simple repo for school work and assignments. 

I like :coffee:.

If you happen across any of my projects, feel free to let me know how awful and unoptimized they are. It helps my learning. Simple improvements or suggestions are always welcome.

Projects:

1. dice.py is an incredibly simple script that simply acts as an RNG. I am new to python and it was simply to practice loops and importing while also being arguably useful.
2. rock,paper,scissors.py is a game of rock paper scissors. Pretty obvious. It doesn't keep score between games, so no leaderboard is possible, becuase I don't know how. :shrug:
3. dice2.0.py is an improved version of a dice roller after learning more. It allows multiple rolls, continuous play, and totalling of scores.
4. Encoder & Decoder is working with tkinter to make a very basic encrypter and decrypter in one window. I could not figure out how to get a dropdown menu to function how I wanted, so there isn't one.
5. Reddit_bot.py is a Reddit bot made using praw. Simply responds to keyphrases in a specific subreddit. It will not double respond due to the skip_existing=True parameter for the comment stream. You must enter your own Reddit API login info, there's lots of tutorials on how to get these online.
