# Python3
A simple repo for school work and assignments. 

I like :coffee:.

If you happen across any of my projects, feel free to let me know how awful and unoptimized they are. It helps my learning. Simple improvements or suggestions are always welcome.

Projects:
  dice.py is an incredibly simple script that simply acts as an RNG. I am new to python and it was simply to practice loops and importing while also being arguably useful.
